# Hi, I'm Meenakshi S 👋

I’m a second-year **Information Technology student** at **Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore**, with a strong interest in **backend development**, **frontend fundamentals**, and **problem-solving**.

I enjoy building structured, real-world projects and learning systems deeply rather than just skimming tools.

## 🔍 What I Focus On
- Backend development using **Java and Spring Boot**
- Designing **REST APIs** with clean layering (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Frontend fundamentals using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Improving logical thinking through **DSA and problem-solving**
- Learning by building complete, explainable projects

I’m currently seeking **internship opportunities** where I can learn, contribute, and grow as a developer.
